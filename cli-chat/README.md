# API Assistant

## Local setup

In order to get started with the `cli-chat` you need to have python >= 3.12 installed and install the `requirement.txt`. The project is using [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html) to build the project based on the [`pyproject.toml`](/cli-chat/pyproject.toml) 

## Requirements
- python >=3.12
- pip install -r `requirement.txt`

## Install locally

```
    > pip install --editable .
    > api-chat
```
